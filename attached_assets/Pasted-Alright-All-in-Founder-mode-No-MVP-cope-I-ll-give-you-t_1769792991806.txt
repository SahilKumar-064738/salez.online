Alright.
**All-in. Founder mode. No MVP-cope.**
I’ll give you the **FULL FEATURE MAP** — not just “what”, but **why**, **order**, and **what actually matters** so you don’t build garbage.

Think of this as your **internal product blueprint**, not a pitch.

# 🧠 CORE IDEA (LOCK THIS FIRST)

Your SaaS = **a memory + timing engine for business conversations**

It does 4 things better than humans:

1. Never forgets
2. Knows when to wait
3. Knows when to nudge
4. Stops when a human replies

Everything below is built around that.

# 🧠 FINAL FOUNDER REALITY CHECK

Going “all-in” does **NOT** mean:

> building everything at once

It means:

> building a **coherent system** where every feature reinforces the same pain

Your north star sentence should always be:

> “Does this help a business forget less and earn more?”

If yes → build
If no → cut

---

## NEXT STEP (CRITICAL)

Since you’re **3 founders**, you should now:

1. Split ownership:

   * Backend / infra
   * Frontend / UX
   * Business / ops
2. Lock **Phase 1 scope**
3. Freeze features for 30 days

If you want, next I can:

* break this into **exact engineering tasks**
* help you split work between 3 founders
* design **DB schema + architecture**
* or help you define **v1 vs v2** cleanly
