Build a production-ready SaaS marketing + onboarding website for an Automated WhatsApp Follow-Up & Reminder product.

Tech stack requirements:

Next.js 14 with App Router

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Fully responsive (mobile-first, WhatsApp users are mostly mobile)

Clean, modern SaaS UI (minimal, calm, trustworthy — not flashy)

No backend logic needed yet, frontend + mock flows only

Use environment variables for future integrations

Code should be clean, modular, and easy to extend into a full app later

Project structure:

app/

page.tsx (landing page)

pricing/page.tsx

demo/page.tsx

auth/

login/page.tsx

signup/page.tsx

dashboard/page.tsx (mock UI, protected later)

components/

Navbar.tsx

Footer.tsx

Hero.tsx

FeatureCard.tsx

HowItWorks.tsx

Testimonials.tsx

PricingCard.tsx

CTA.tsx

lib/

constants.ts

styles handled fully via Tailwind

Global requirements:

Sticky navbar with logo, Features, Pricing, Demo, Login

Clear WhatsApp-first positioning

Copy should focus on “no lead is forgotten”, “automatic follow-ups”, “peace of mind”

No mention of spam, bulk messaging, or cold outreach

Tone should feel human and business-friendly

Landing page requirements (app/page.tsx):

Hero section:

Headline: “Never forget to follow up on WhatsApp”

Subheading explaining automated reminders for leads, payments, and appointments

Primary CTA button: “See WhatsApp demo”

Secondary CTA: “Start free trial”

Include subtle WhatsApp-style UI mock (chat bubbles, reminder message preview)

Problem section:

Show 3 pains:

leads go cold due to silence

payments are forgotten

manual follow-ups feel awkward

Use icons and short copy

How it works section:
Step 1: Connect your WhatsApp Business
Step 2: Set simple follow-up rules (time-based)
Step 3: We automatically remind customers
Step 4: Automation stops instantly when they reply

Features section:

Automatic lead creation

Follow-up rules engine

Auto-pause on reply

Payment reminders

Appointment reminders

Unified inbox
Each feature should be a reusable FeatureCard component

Who it’s for section:

Clinics

Coaching institutes

Salons

Real estate agents

Service businesses
Display as cards with short descriptions

Testimonials section:

Use realistic mock testimonials from business owners

Focus on recovered revenue and peace of mind

CTA section:

Strong statement: “One forgotten follow-up can cost more than this tool”

Button linking to signup

Pricing page (/pricing):

3 plans:
Starter: ₹999/month
Growth: ₹1999/month
Pro: ₹2999/month

Clearly list WhatsApp follow-ups, reminders, and limits

Emphasize ROI rather than features

“Cancel anytime” reassurance

Demo page (/demo):

Simulated WhatsApp conversation UI

Show:

customer sends message

no reply for 2 days

automated follow-up message appears

customer replies

automation stops

This is frontend-only simulation

Auth pages:

Login and Signup pages with clean forms

Fields only (no real auth yet)

Prepare structure for future authentication

Dashboard page (/dashboard):

Mock dashboard UI:

list of conversations

lead status (new, interested, paid, lost)

upcoming reminders

No real data, just static mock JSON

UI/UX constraints:

Use Tailwind with neutral colors (gray, slate, subtle green)

WhatsApp green only as an accent, not dominant

Plenty of whitespace

Clear hierarchy, no clutter

Code quality:

Use reusable components

Use proper TypeScript types

Add comments where future backend logic will go

No unnecessary libraries

Final output:

Fully working Next.js app that runs immediately

Ready to deploy

Easy to extend into a real SaaS app later
